  <LongDescription>## Line Tool
This mod supplements existing tools so you can precisely and quickly place objects such as trees, shrubs, and props in lines, curves, and circles with varying parameters.

## Features
- **Integrates directly with in-game tools**: No hotkey required.
- **Place objects in lines**: Create straight lines, curves, or circles.
- Works both *in-game* and *in the editor*.
- **Fence mode**: Automatically align and place objects end-to-end.
- **Wall-to-wall mode**: Automatically align and place objects side-to-side.
- **Accurate placement**: No worrying about imprecision.
- **Adjust spacing and rotation**: Use the in-game tool UI for more control, including random rotation for a more natural look.
- **Random position variation** (optional): Provides natural irregularity.
- **Live preview**: Provisionally place a line, adjust spacing and/or rotation, and see how it looks in real-time before making the final placement (or cancelling).
- Displays distances and angles for fine-tuning.

## Usage
- To activate the tool, select the object that you'd like to place in a line (such as a tree), either normally or with the Dev UI. Then, select a line mode from the line modes options at the bottom of the tool options panel.
- To exit the tool, select 'single placement mode' to return to the normal placement mode for the selected object, or press **Escape**.

### Place a line
- **Click** where you want the line to begin, and click again at the desired endpoint to place the objects. **Note**: Curves require three clicks - start, guidepoint, and end.
- **Shift-click** at the end of a line starts a new line placement at the spot where the previous line ended.
- **Control-click** at the end of a line leaves it in preview mode; you can adjust the settings and see the results in real-time. You can also drag the highlighted control points (blue circles) to adjust the line positioning (**Control-click** to start dragging ensures that you don't accidentally trigger placement if you miss the point circles, but regular clicking also works). When finished, **click** to place or **right-click** to cancel.
- **Right-click** to cancel placement.

### Tool options
- Toggle between **single object** (default game tool), **straight line**, **curved**, and **circle** modes.
- Toggle **fence mode** to align objects with the line direction, and place them continuously end-to-end (like a fence).
- Toggle **wall-to-wall mode** to align objects with the line direction, and place them continuously side-to-side (like a row of buildings).
- Adjust **distances** using the arrow buttons - click for 1m increments, **Shift-click** for 10m, and **Control-click** for 0.1m. For circle mode, spacing is rounded *up* to the nearest distance that ensures an even placement around the circle.
- Select **fixed-length even spacing mode** to space out objects evenly over the entire length of the line, with spacing *as close as possible* to the spacing distance you set.  For circle mode, this causes spacing to be rounded to the *nearest number* (up or down) that ensures an even placement around the circle (default circle rounding is always *up*).
- Select **random rotation** to have each object in the line have a different randomly-chosen rotation, or manually adjust the rotation for all items using the arrow buttons - click for 10-degree increments, **Shift-click** for 90 degrees, **Control-click** for 1 degree.
- Set **variable spacing** greater than zero to apply a random length offset to each item's spacing, up to the maximum distance specified - click for 1m increments, **Shift-click** for 10m, **Control-click** for 0.1m.
- Set **variable offset** greater than zero to apply a random sideways offset to each item, up to the maximum distance specified - click for 1m increments, **Shift-click** for 10m, **Control-click** for 0.1m.

To remove variable spacing and/or offset, set the field(s) back to zero. **Shift-click** (10m increments) to make this faster.
